# Beth Scholze Individual Project

## Problem Statement

Many avid readers have extensive lists of books they have read and plan to read. 
It can be hard to keep these lists organized and track which books you 
have, want to rent, or want to buy. Traditional websites such as 
GoodReads allow you to make reading lists but do not provide a 
good way to sort your lists, analyze your book data, and inventory where you will get books. I
hope to change that with Bookshelf Banshee, a website that allows you to 
inventory your books and create and sort reading lists based on data you enter.
